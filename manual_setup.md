# Manual Settop

In the future I need to find ways to automate this part of the setup. Currently
doing this manually.

## Update Keyboard
- [ ] System Settings > Keyboard > Change Key Repeat rate to `fast`
- [ ] System Settings > Keyboard > Change Delay Until Repeat to `Short`
- [ ] System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts... > Modifier Keys > Remap `Caps Lock key` to be `Control`

## Update Appearance
- [ ] System Settings > Appearance > Change Appearance to be `Auto`
- [ ] System Settings > Control Center > Battery > Turn ON `Show Percentage`
- [ ] System Settings > Control Center > Clock Options... > Turn ON `Display the
time with seconds`
- [ ] System Settings > Desktop & Dock > Set `Double-click a window's title bar
  to` `Fill`.
- [ ] System Settings > Displays > Night Shift... > Set Schedule to `Sunset to
  Sunrise` (Note: You may need to also turn on location services to do this.)
- [ ] System Settings > Displays > Set Resolution to `More Space`

## Terminal
- [ ] Import the `Jellybeans-RHedges.terminal` to terminal `Preferences` -> `Profiles`

## Xcode
- [ ] Install Xcode from the mac app store.
- [ ] May need to select "Command Lin Tools" in Xcode by going to `Preferences` -> `Locations` if Brew doesn't install it for you.

## Applications

There are several applications that are installed via [Homebrew
cask's](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/). Review the script, open the added
applications, and configure them as needed.

### Maccy

### Sublime Merge
- [ ] Add License
        * Open Sublime Merge, and select the menu item Help / Enter License
        * Copy the license above (including the BEGIN LICENSE and END LICENSE lines) and paste them into the license box. Press OK and Sublime Merge will enter into licensed mode: You should see that UNREGISTERED is no longer in the window title.
