# Manual Settop

In the future I need to find ways to automate this part of the setup. Currently
doing this manually.

- Change Key Repeat speed to `fast`
- Change Delay Until Repeat to `Short`
- Remap `caps lock` to be `ctrl`
- May need to select "Command Lin Tools" in Xcode by going to `Preferences` -> `Locations`
